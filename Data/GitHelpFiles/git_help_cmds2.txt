GIR BRANCHING MODEL:
-------------------

1. git branch -a -> List all local branches in repository. With -a: show all branches
(with remote).

2. git branch [branch_name] -> Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.

3. git checkout -b [branch name] -> Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.

4. git merge [from name] -> Join specified [from name] branch into your current branch (the one
you are on currently).

5. git branch -d [name] -> Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other.
-D instead of -d forces deletion

SYNCHRONIZING REPOSITORIES:
--------------------------

1. git fetch -> Fetch changes from the remote, but not update tracking branches.

2. git pull -> Fetch changes from the remote and merge current branch with its upstream.

3. git push -> Push local changes to the remote. Use --tags to push tags.


IGNORING FILE:

step 1:- Create a file in the repo/project with name .gitignore

step 2:- write the file name you don't want to track.

[ NOTE: if there are more thann 1 file(s) which you don't want to track then write each file name in each new line. ]
