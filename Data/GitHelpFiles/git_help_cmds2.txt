REVIEW YOUR WORK:
----------------

1. git log -> List commit history of current branch in elaborate form

2. git log --oneline -> An overview with reference labels in One commit per line.


GIR BRANCHING MODEL:
-------------------

1. git branch -a -> List all local branches in repository. With -a: show all branches
(with remote).

2. git branch [branch_name] -> Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.

3. git checkout -b [branch name] -> Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.

4. git merge [from name] -> Join specified [from name] branch into your current branch (the one
you are on currently).

5. git branch -d [name] -> Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other.
-D instead of -d forces deletion
