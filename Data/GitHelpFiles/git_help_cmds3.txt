SYNCHRONIZING REPOSITORIES:
--------------------------

1. git fetch -> Fetch changes from the remote, but not update tracking branches.

2. git pull -> Fetch changes from the remote and merge current branch with its upstream.

3. git push -> Push local changes to the remote. Use --tags to push tags.


IGNORING FILE:
-------------

step 1:- Create a file in the repo/project with name .gitignore

step 2:- write the file name you don't want to track.

[ NOTE: if there are more thann 1 file(s) which you don't want to track then write each file name in each new line. ]
