DAY-TO-DAY WORK:
---------------

1. git status -> Displays the status of your working directory. Options include new, staged, and modified files.

2. git add [file name] -> Add a file to the staging area. Use '.' in place of the full file path to add all changed 
files from the current directory

3. git checkout -- [file name] -> Discard changes in working directory. This operation is unrecoverable.

4. git reset [file name] -> Revert your repository to a previous known working state.

5. git commit -m ["commit message"] -> Create a new commit from changes added to the staging area. 
The commit must have a message!
